# OneLastAI Production Readiness Report

## üéØ Mission Accomplished: CineGen Agent Production Enhancement

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
1. **Agent Model Architecture** - Created comprehensive Agent, AgentInteraction, and AgentMemory models
2. **AI Engine Integration** - Built AiModelService and AiAgentEngine base classes 
3. **CineGen Specialization** - Implemented CinegenAgentEngine with video-specific capabilities
4. **Docker AI Models** - Single Ollama service option (Option B) with 5 core models (Llama3.2, Gemma2, Phi3, DeepSeek Coder, Mistral)
5. **Production Deployment** - Automated scripts for full production deployment
6. **Controller Integration** - Updated CineGen controller to use new AI engine architecture

## üöÄ AI Models Ready for Production

### Model Configuration
 - **Llama 3.2 (3.21B)** - General purpose, lightweight responses
- **Gemma 3 (3.88B)** - Port 11435 - Specialized tasks, efficient processing  
- **Phi-4 (14.66B)** - Port 11436 - Advanced reasoning, code generation
 - **DeepSeek Coder (6.7B)** - Code-focused reasoning

## Option B: Single Ollama Service (Recommended for Railway)

We support deploying one Ollama service and selecting models by name at runtime. The app now uses `AiModelService` with a single base URL (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL`).

How to run locally:

1) Start Ollama with required models

  docker compose -f docker-compose.ollama.yml up -d

2) Set environment

  OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

3) App will call `POST /api/generate` with the chosen model name.

Railway hints:
- Create a new service from `ollama/ollama:latest`, expose `11434`, and set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`.
- On first boot, exec into the service and pull models with `ollama pull ...` or bake via a custom start command.
- Set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in the Rails service to the Ollama service URL.
- **GPT-OSS** - Port 11438 - Creative writing, conversation

### Gateway & Load Balancing
- **AI Gateway** - Port 8080 - Smart routing and load balancing
- **Nginx Configuration** - Rate limiting, health checks, failover
- **Model Selection** - Automatic best-model routing based on task type
